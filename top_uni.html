<h1>The World's Top 5 Universities</h1>
<p>Hello this is Ahmad Arafat, this is my first web page &#128515;</p>
<h2>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) </h2>
<p><b>1-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</b> is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
The institute is a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant university, with an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River.
 The institute also encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. It has since played a key role in the development of many aspects of modern science, engineering, mathematics, and technology, and is widely known for its innovation and academic strength.<br>website : <a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<h2>2-Stanford University</h2>
<p><b>Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University</b>, is a private research university in Stanford, California.<br>Stanford is ranked among the top five universities in the world in major education publications.
The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a U.S. Senator and former Governor of California who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891, as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.<br>

<h2>3-Harvard University</h2>
<p><b>Harvard University</b> is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, clergyman John Harvard, Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and among the most prestigious in the world.<br>
The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of academic disciplines for undergraduates and for graduates, while the other faculties offer only graduate degrees, mostly professional.<br>

<h2>4-California Institute of Technology</h2>
<p>The <b>California Institute of Technology</b> (Caltech)<br>is a private research university in Pasadena, California. It was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891 and began attracting influential scientists in the early 20th century.<br>
 The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán.[8][9] The university is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.<br>

 <h2>5-University of Oxford</h2>
 <p>The <b>University of Oxford</b> (legally The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford) is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England.<br> There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are often jointly called Oxbridge.<br>
 The university is made up of 39 semi-autonomous constituent colleges, six permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford is organised around weekly small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls – a feature unique to the Oxbridge system. These are supported by classes, lectures, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided predominantly centrally.<br>
